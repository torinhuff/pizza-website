# Torin's Pizza Parlor

#### A _JavaScript_ exercise, Oct/26/2018

#### By Torin Huff

## Description

This website will allow a user to order any size pizza, with as many of the available toppings as they desire, from a fictional pizza parlor. They will be given the option to 'pick up' their pizza at the fictional location, or they can fill out the form to have their pizza 'delivered' to their location. The user will be able to check the total of their pizza while they are selecting their size and toppings, and they will be given their final total once they are ready. The goal of this project was to explore objects and prototypes in JavaScript.
